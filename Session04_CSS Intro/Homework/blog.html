        <h1 style="float:left; width: 400px;"> Hello, <br> a bit about me</h1>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Created on 28th of June</p>
        <p> My name is Stana Elena Bianca. I am 26 years old. From a very young age I have understood the importance of good education. Early into my education experience I strived to bring home good results on school and every time I managed to be among the best. I am a hard working person and I realised that for me to achieve my personal best became a priority and a natural habit. </p>
        <p> By beeing motivated to work hard, when I was in highschool I developed a sense of leadership by leading my handball team, and every day I feel like I could be a good leader for any team.</p> 
        <p> The qualities that best represents me in life is <emphasize> fairness</emphasize> and <emphasize> ambition</emphasize>. When I want to achieve something I can work long hours to have the best results.<br> I can admit that some of my defects are the perfectionism and self-criticism. Sometimes I forget that there are certain limits in certain uncontrollable situations.</p>

           <p>Some of my hobbies:</p>
          <ul class="a">
            <li>Personal development is one of the most important goals in my life. My favourite book is <i>Blink - Malcom Gladwell</i> but many other personal development books guide me to a better version of myself. </li>
            <li>When I want to relax with friends, board games are the best option. Activity is my favourite board game.</li>
            <li> Since I was little, I've been flirting with music. At the age of 10 I had my first contact with the stage, when I had to sing a song for my mother's day and I chose to go on with a few canto hours.For now is just a passion.</li>
            <li>Beating boys at table tennis has become a goal for me. I like to play tenis and for me is a good relax.</li>
            <li>I like to do sport. I like to go to gym for Zomba, I like to ride a bike and to play any games that involve teams.</li>
