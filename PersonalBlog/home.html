            <p>  We all want success. We want to be successful and feel successful. We chase money, fame, power, education, relationships and a thousand other things without ever stopping to ask one essential question: What, actually, is success?</p>
            <br>
            <p>   Success to me, is finding a career that I love. I’m so grateful to have found something that I’m infinitely passionate about. This blog is something that I’ve worked so hard on since the very beginning, and to now be doing this as my job, to me… is the real definition of success.</p>
            <br>
            <p>   It has very little to do with the numbers on my bank statement or how much money is in my pocket. Money is just one byproduct of success and does not equal success itself. You can be successful without having made a dollar and you can make a million without ever being successful in what you set out to do. Success is accomplishing what you set out to, which is why it’s subjective.</p>     
            <br>
            <p>Be realistic and concrete when setting goals. Success does not come from setting abstract goals. If you know where you’re heading, that is a success in itself, even if you don’t ultimately arrive to the planned destination.</p>
