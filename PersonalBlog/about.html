        <p> My name is Stana Elena Bianca. I am 26 years old. I was borned in Curtea de Arges and I live in Bucharest from 7 years. From a very young age I have understood the importance of good education. Early into my education experience I strived to bring home good results on school and every time I managed to be among the best. I am a hard working person and I realised that for me to achieve my personal best became a priority and a natural habit. </p>
        <p> By beeing motivated to work hard, when I was in highschool I developed a sense of leadership by leading my handball team, and every day I feel like I could be a good leader for any team.</p> 
        <p> The qualities that best represents me in life is <emphasize> fairness</emphasize> and <emphasize> ambition</emphasize>. When I want to achieve something I can work long hours to have the best results.<br> I can admit that some of my defects are the perfectionism and self-criticism. Sometimes I forget that there are certain limits in certain uncontrollable situations.</p>

                   Personal development is one of the most important goals in my life. My favourite book is <i>Blink - Malcom Gladwell</i> but many other personal development books guide me to a better version of myself.

                   Since I was little, I've been flirting with music. At the age of 10 I had my first contact with the stage, when I had to sing a song for my mother's day and I chose to go on with a few canto hours.For now is just a passion.
